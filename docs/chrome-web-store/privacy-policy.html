  <h1>SourceFence Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: 17 February 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    SourceFence is a browser extension that helps recruiters maintain sourcing compliance
    on LinkedIn. This privacy policy explains how SourceFence handles your data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The short version:</strong> SourceFence does not collect, transmit, or store
    any personal data. Everything stays in your browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>SourceFence does <strong>not</strong> collect any data. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal information is collected from you or from LinkedIn profiles you view</li>
    <li>No analytics or tracking scripts are included</li>
    <li>No cookies are set by the extension</li>
    <li>No network requests are made to any external server</li>
    <li>No data is transmitted outside of your browser</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How SourceFence Works</h2>
  <p>
    SourceFence reads publicly displayed information on LinkedIn pages (such as candidate
    name, location, and current employer) solely to compare it against restriction rules
    that <em>you</em> have configured. This comparison happens entirely within your browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    The restriction rules you create (location patterns, company names, severity levels,
    and compliance notes) are stored locally in your browser using the Chrome Storage API.
    This data never leaves your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    All data used by SourceFence is stored locally in your browser via
    <code>chrome.storage.local</code>. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your restriction rules (locations and companies)</li>
    <li>Your extension settings (enabled state, alert preferences)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is automatically removed if you uninstall the extension. You can also
    clear it at any time by removing your rules through the extension popup.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    SourceFence does not integrate with, send data to, or receive data from any
    third-party services, APIs, or servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>SourceFence requests the following browser permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>storage</strong> — To save your restriction rules and settings locally
      in the browser
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>activeTab</strong> — To read the currently displayed LinkedIn page and
      show compliance alerts
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>host_permissions (linkedin.com)</strong> — To inject compliance alerts
      and read profile information on LinkedIn pages
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>LinkedIn Data</h2>
  <p>
    SourceFence reads information that is already visible to you on LinkedIn pages.
    It does not access any data beyond what is displayed in your browser, does not
    interact with the LinkedIn API, and does not store or export any LinkedIn profile
    data. The extension solely performs local pattern matching to display compliance
    alerts.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    SourceFence is a professional tool for recruiters. It is not directed at children
    under 13 and does not knowingly collect any information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date
    at the top of this page. Continued use of SourceFence after changes constitutes
    acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Google API Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    SourceFence's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the
    <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/limited-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    Chrome Web Store User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.

SourceFence — Sourcing Compliance for Recruiters

## Summary (max 132 chars)
Flags restricted locations and companies on LinkedIn profiles in real time so recruiters stay compliant before reaching out.

## Detailed Description

SourceFence helps recruitment teams stay compliant by flagging restricted candidates directly on LinkedIn. Set up location and company restriction rules, and SourceFence will alert you in real time as you browse profiles and search results.

**How it works:**
- Add restriction rules for locations (e.g. countries, cities, regions) and companies (e.g. non-solicit agreements, off-limits clients)
- Choose a severity level for each rule: Red (Restricted) or Amber (Caution)
- Browse LinkedIn as normal — SourceFence checks every profile automatically
- See clear alert banners on profile pages and badges on search result cards
- Green confirmation when a candidate has no restrictions

**Where it works:**
- LinkedIn standard profiles (/in/)
- LinkedIn Recruiter (/talent/)
- LinkedIn search results with per-candidate badges

**Key features:**
- Instant visual alerts — no need to check a separate tool
- Works on profile pages and search results
- Comma-separated patterns for location rules (e.g. "Germany, Berlin, Munich")
- Automatic company name normalization (handles Inc, Ltd, Corp, GmbH, etc.)
- Optional expiry dates on company rules for time-limited agreements
- Customisable settings: enable/disable alerts, auto-dismiss green banners
- All rules stored locally in your browser — nothing leaves your device
- Zero external network requests — fully offline after install

**Built for recruiters who need to:**
- Honour non-solicit and non-compete agreements
- Respect geographic sourcing restrictions
- Avoid reaching out to candidates at off-limits companies
- Maintain compliance with client contracts

SourceFence is lightweight, privacy-first, and runs entirely in your browser. No accounts, no sign-ups, no data collection.
